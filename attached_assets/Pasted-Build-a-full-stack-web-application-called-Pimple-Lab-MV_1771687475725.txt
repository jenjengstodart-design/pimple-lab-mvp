Build a full-stack web application called "Pimple Lab – MVP".

Purpose:
This is a hackathon MVP demonstrating how MedGemma can help structure teenage acne experimentation. This is NOT a medical diagnostic tool. It is educational and experimental only.

STACK:
- Node.js backend (Express)
- Simple frontend (HTML + minimal CSS or React if easier)
- SQLite database
- Store uploaded images locally
- Prepare for HuggingFace endpoint integration

CORE FEATURES:

1. Home Page
- Title: Pimple Lab
- Subtitle: Turn teenage skincare into a science experiment
- Clear disclaimer:
  "This tool is not medical advice. It is for educational experimentation only."
- Button: Start Experiment

2. Initial Snapshot Page
Collect:
- Upload facial skin image
- Age (number input)
- Stress level (1–5)
- Daily makeup? (yes/no)
- Sport frequency (low/medium/high)
- Optional menstrual cycle phase

On submit:
Call backend function analyze_with_medgemma(image, context)

3. MedGemma Wrapper (IMPORTANT)
Create a backend function called:

async function analyze_with_medgemma(imageBase64, context)

Inside it:
- Prepare structured prompt
- Send POST request to HuggingFace endpoint using process.env.HF_TOKEN
- Return structured JSON

If environment variable USE_REAL_MEDGEMMA is false:
Return mock response:

{
  acne_type: "Hormonal",
  confidence: 72,
  visual_features: ["Inflammatory papules along jawline"],
  context_factors: ["High stress reported"],
  experiment_hypothesis: "A salicylic acid routine may reduce inflammation over 14 days."
}

4. Hypothesis Page
Display:
- Acne type
- Confidence %
- Visual reasoning summary
- Suggested experiment hypothesis

Allow user to:
- Accept or override acne type
- Write routine description
- Choose experiment duration (7 or 14 days)

5. Superdrug Product Suggestions
Create a local dataset of 12 acne-friendly Superdrug products with:
- name
- category (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, antifungal-friendly, gentle cleanser, oil-free moisturiser)
- price placeholder
- link placeholder

Map acne type to 3 recommended products.

6. Daily Check-In
- Adherence slider (0–100%)
- Stress level
- Makeup today? yes/no
Save entries to database.

7. Follow-Up Snapshot
- Upload second image
- Self-assess: Better / Same / Worse

8. Results Page
Show:
- Before/After images side-by-side
- Hypothesis
- Average adherence
- Outcome summary
- Statement: "This contributes to structured teenage skincare research."

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use environment variable HF_TOKEN for HuggingFace auth
- Use environment variable USE_REAL_MEDGEMMA
- Keep code clean and well-commented
- Prepare analyze_with_medgemma() for easy endpoint insertion
- Mobile responsive

Do not overengineer.
This is a working MVP for a hackathon.
